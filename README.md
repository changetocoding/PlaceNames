https://raw.githubusercontent.com/changetocoding/CSharpTraining/main/Lesson-10-multi/PlaceNamesUkWithC.txt

## Purpose
- Test basic C# skills
- Copying data between classes.

## Task
You have been given a class that reads in the place names file. You just need to provide where the file is located.

1. Load data from file into your own C# class that has 3 properties: TownName, State, Country
2. If a town name has a () remove all the text within the braces. E.g `Cam (Rhee)` => `Cam`

Add a console user interface:
3. Find all duplicate town names and the total number of times each one is duplicated. Display this ordered by number of duplicates. Do not display town names that are not duplicated. (e.g. California is duplicated 5 times)
4. Given a town name display a list of States and Countries it belongs to. (e.g. California belongs to the states: Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, ... and Countries: England, Scotland)
5. Given a state, display a list of all towns in that state, and the country the state belongs to.
